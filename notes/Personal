Trace,
Trace,
found an interesting little thing when i logged in today.  There was 
a juve (from megacity) wandering around in Hell.  This was no
ordinary juve tho.  Dude had a normal Juve's hp, which means 1 hit
and it was dead, however its level was waaaaaaaaay increased.  First
off it took me about 12 rounds to actually hit it (it never hit me once), but
then when i got the hit, i got 64k exp.  Juve, had a bodypart
of Ryath on him when i killed him.  You might wanna look into that.
sounds an awful lot like an imm msettign wimpy mobs with high levels
to give lotsa exp....(sounds an awful lot like what used to happen
on the mud with the smaug code a few months back)  Just wanted ya
to be aware.

Subject Castle Descriptions~
Text
Trace,
Here are the room descriptions for my castle.
 
Entrance
You have stumbled upon the main gate of Castle Pestilence.  A
huge portcullis hangs above your head.  The ground at your feet
is dead and barren.  There are no animals in sight, and the plant
life is brown and wilted.  The odor of rotting flesh permiates
the air around you, it is the smell of Death itself.  The castle
walls are a polished redish steel that you have seen many times
before.  The air is dead and silent, save for a few muffled 
screams from deep within the castle walls.
 
Guard Post
You are such a brave soul, one of few who have ventured into
Castle Pestilence without an invitation AND and escort.  As you
glance around you notice you are standing in a pool of dried blood
and shattered bones litter the ground.  Just then you feel a blast
of hot air on the back of your neck.  A voice echos throught 
the chamber......"Ahh yes, A brave soul indeed, but a soul I will
soon have just the same!"  Before you can turn around........
 
just plain Entrance.
oops...
ignore that just plain entrance :)
Note   Please change Entrance to Entrance to Castle Pestilence.
 
Altar of Death
This is a simple room, tables with vairious food and drink line
the walls.  Servants hustle about making sure that your needs
are met quickly.  Blood seeps from the wall in one corner and 
fills a cauldron at its base.  In the center of the room stands
an occultist chained to the floor.  Enslaved by Moloch many
years ago and forced into servitude in exchange for her life.
Without even asking, she assesses your pain and begins healing
your wounds.
 
Please make altar a safe room.

Room of Mists
This is an eerie room, filled with strange colored mists.  Faint
shadows are all that can be seen.  The walls feel smooth
and hot to the touch.  Looking up the mist continue endlessly
and downward there appears to be no floor...as if you 
are standing in a void.  A small crystal floats in the center
of the room.
 
Crystal description- As you gaze into the crystal, familiar images
can be seen. Each facet showing a different location (colon)-
You see a man carying a large axe, a minotaur guarding a gate,
a dark skinned elf, strange rock creature, a large pyramid,
a staff member, A large man holding an hourglass, a bright comet, 
a multicolored cat, a well aremed trooper, a dragon-like creature,
and a merman with a large glowing trident.
 
 
got a to long line message ill try again...please make this a portal
room to   midgaard,drow,elemental,sphinx,staff,timelord,galaxy
high tower of sorcery,doom,draconia and atlantis.  Also, please
make this the krecall spot. 
 
Throneroom
You have entered the throneroom of Moloch, King of Pestilence.
Weapons of every type are mounted on the walls.  On the north
wall lies a throne crafted of red and black demonsteel.  Along
the entire west wall is what appears to be a trophy wall.  Rows
of shelves with the cracked open skulls of those whose souls 
Moloch has taken.
 
As far as an item to defend....what are my options with this?
Also i would like to buy a second level 500 guardian if possible for the
guard post.

It looks like you worked on vamp blood a little, i notice when
i embrace a mob, my blood can go up to 300 now.  Thats great!
however, if i drink from the blood rod, it goes only to 100 max.
even if I have 200 blood when i drink, it drops down to 100.
Additionally, i still have abilities...even at 300 blood
that i an unable to use due to insufficient blood.
 
I was wondering if you could increase blood to 5 or 6 hundred
and also decrease the rate of 'blood loss' a little.  It goes
away so quickly that i literally have to drink blood ever
two minutes or im rageing due to lack of blood.
 
Thanks
