The door slams behind you.  All you see is
darkness and walls that are splattered with bits
of blood and gore.  A large green pool is in the
center of the room, and you haven't the slightest
idea what is inside. You just know you aren't in Kansas anymore.

The center of the arena~
You have found the biggest, baddest space marine
of them all.  He is standing here upon a pile of
corpses, and is smirking at you the moment you
enter the room.  He looks like he is happy to see
you.

A small room~
This room appears to be a closet of some sort,
maybe an elevator even.  On the wall is a large
switch, and above it some words are scribbled
upon the wall.
