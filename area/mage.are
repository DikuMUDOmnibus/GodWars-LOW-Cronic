The Entrace To The Mages Tower~
You are standing in the entrace the mages fortress.  A single stoney digit
pointing straight up towards the heavens it represents the power of the
universe.  Simple, but having withstood the ravages of the years the magics
which have been cast within have given the stonework a semi-intelligence all
of its own.

Main Hallway~
Large wooden staircases lead up around the outside walls and meet at the
top.  A large crystal chandelier hangs down illuminating all below.  Many
statues of old mages are in small alcoves in the wall while at the very
top of the staircase a large statue of the mage who made this tower watches
over the current ensemble.

The Spell Casting Camber~
You stand in the centre of a large stone room which is at the very centre
of the tower.  The five corners of the master pentagram are marked by a 
large crystal ball held up by a dragons claw, a pool of water, a brazier 
filled with flames, a lecturn with an open book and a sceptre.  The walls
are covered by racks and racks of magical tombs which contain much of
the arcane wisdom and lore of the meges.

Meeting Hall~
Around a large oak table rests five chairs; one for each of the five arch-
mages arranged as though in the form of a pentagram.  Behind each of the
chairs a small stool waits for the arch-mages principle apprentice and
advisor.  The heavy oak panneling gives off a heady armoma of beeswax
which has been polished into it over the years.

The Blue Temple~
You enter the temple, looking around with wonder at the dusty monument's 
interior.  From the carvings and inscriptions, you guess that it was built 
by elves and dwarves together during a peaceful age long ago.  Dust covers 
almost everything, especially the stairs leading down into the earth by 
the nave.

At the bottom of a green tower.~
Before you stands a marble needle that thrusts it way up, stretching 
higher than you can see into the black, storm-ridden sky.  Steps lead up 
to a point where you think a door should exist, but it does not, and green 
veins thread their way in an intricate pattern around the structure,  
pulsing with an arcane life.  These veins draw you attention in an  
abnormal manner as you you feel yourself being beckoned towards the 
tower.  As you stumble closer, you hear hushed mutterings and whispers 
from inside.  Your heartbeat starts to thud in your ears, thudding in time
with the pulsing veins as you feel a sharp tug at your avatar.  Now would 
be a good time to leave you think.

Inside the Marble Tower.~
You feel giddy as you materialise in this room.  You open your eyes to 
see a massive room lined with green crystals of varying shapes and sizes 
which cast light throughout the room.  Feeling a presence behind you, you 
spin around in shock to stare upwards at a golem twice your height and 
width! It motions with its hands and a metallic orb appears between them, 
crackling as sparks of electricity shoot out in random directions.  You
hear a sigh descending from above as a brilliant white light pours from 
the ceiling, condensing into a portal.

The Node Room.~
Emerging into the room you find yourself confronted with a statue that 
blasts out power in all directions.  You feel immensely invigorated, but you 
realise that getting any nearer would result in excessive intake of 
magical power which would probably result in death.  From where you are, 
you can just about make out a plaque on its base.  A door leads south.

A plaque on its base reads: "Here stands Queztalcoatl.  Once a great man, 
but no-one can overcome the might the the Aztec God Huitzilopoctli."

Fool's Paradise.~
As you step into the room, you think WOW!  Jewels and money litters the 
floor between extravagant plates of food.  Members of the opposite sex 
dance around you lightening your mood.  Simple dancing turns slowly into 
flirtation as you become more and more relaxed, enjoying the atmosphere. 
The last thing you feel is a sharp pain in the centre of your back as 
the Skriazit's claim their prize ...

The Horizon Realm.~
As you enter the room, things aren't quite what they seem.  You appear to 
have stepped into an alternate reality.  The whole room is made from 
completely green marble which exudes peace and serenity.  You feel as 
though you could sleep here forever.  Strange runes and sigils are 
enscribed all over the walls, each appearing to be linked in a strange 
fashion, combining to some invisible end, and metallic emerald globes
float in the air.  As you walk over to one to examine it further, a beam 
of light fires out from one, hitting another, starting a chain reaction
which causes the whole room to be filled with a blinding green light.  You 
realise you had better leave before the master of the tower returns.

The Gateway To The Planes~
In a small chamber with a high vaulted stone ceiling many painting hang
upon the walls.  They show, in their faded paints, the masters who have
worked in this chamber over tha ages.  To the west through an old curtain 
the fabled gateway to other worlds awaits.

Clan Portals~
In ancient times the civilisation which built this tower constructed
portals to other parts of their world.  Above each portal is a series of
runes which are written in the strange symbols which are all over this
ancient place.  You feel as though you could just step into the pictures and
be there.  The east portal leads back into the temple, while to the north
lies a portal to the Temple of Midgaard.  To the west of you lies the great
Tower of High Sorcery, and to your south you see the tower of Draconia.  A
set of stair lead downwards to another room similar to this one.

Clan Portals~
In ancient times the civilisation which built this place contructed
portals to other parts of their world.  Above each portal is a series of
runes which are written in the strange symbols which appear all around this
ancient place.  Looking through the portals, you see clear images of far off
places; To the east you spy a futuristic city, while to the west lies a huge
webbed cave entrance.  The northern portal leads to a city populated by
minotaurs, and looking south you see hundreds of stars in a scene of
darkness.  The stairway continues further downwards.

You finally reach the bottom of the stairway.  To your north, the portal
leads into a modern looking city of Thalos, whilst to your south you see the
city of the gods.  The eastern portal leads to the great city of Ofcol,
while looking through the western portal you see a city of evil drow.
