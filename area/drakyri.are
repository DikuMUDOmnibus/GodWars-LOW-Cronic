blue marble fountain~
Blue marble, so dark as to appear black in patches where shadows have
fallen over the stone, has been sculpted into the form of a tall
sorceress, hands raised in the act of casting a spell.  Crystalline
water splashes from the sorceress' open palm, sparkling like colour
spray in the light.  The narrow face and chiseled cheekbones appear
elven, but twin wings rise from the shoulderblades, sculpted feathers
cascading over the sorceress' back like a cloak.

to your own and seems to smile mysteriously up at you.  The water
ripples and clears, leaving only your reflection.. or perhaps the vision
was just your imagination?  The water sparkles in the light.
