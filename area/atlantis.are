The edge of the Wood~
You are standing in a nice looking nature. There are birds singing everywhere
and you see all sorts of tree. The most trees are not very old, but there is
one big old oak in the middle. There is a road lying to the east and it looks
the same as this. To the south you notice the Martinus Street.
